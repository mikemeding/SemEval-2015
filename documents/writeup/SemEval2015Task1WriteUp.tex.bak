\begin{abstract}
Hoanh and I decided that we would do the SemEval 2015 Task 1 which is paraphrase and semantic similarity in Twitter. The task description is as follows, Given two sentences, the participants are asked to determine whether they express the same or very similar meaning and optionally a degree score between 0 and 1. Following the literature on paraphrase identification, we evaluate system performance primarily by the F-1 score and Accuracy against human judgements. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
\paragraph{} 
Our first task with this project was to translate the original starting code from Python to Java.

\section{Double-blind review process}
\label{sec:blind}

As the reviewing will be blind, the paper must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., ``We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'' must be avoided. Instead, use citations such as ``Smith previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...'' Papers that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. In addition, please do not post your submissions on the web until after the review process is complete.
